# 🧠 MozhiMathi AI

> **An AI-Powered Tamil Technical Linter & Writing Assistant**

MozhiMathi AI is an intelligent writing assistant designed to help users write **technically accurate and standardized Tamil**. Instead of functioning as a chatbot or a generic translator, it acts as a **Tamil Technical Linter**, reviewing technical content in real time, identifying terminology inconsistencies, and recommending official Tamil technical terms backed by a curated knowledge base.
 
---

## 📖 Overview

Technical Tamil resources are available across government publications, glossaries, and dictionaries. However, these resources are difficult to search and cannot assist users while writing. Existing translation tools often generate inconsistent terminology and lack awareness of official technical standards.

MozhiMathi AI bridges this gap by combining **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, and a **structured PostgreSQL knowledge base** to provide context-aware terminology recommendations, explanations, and writing assistance.
